      {
        id: "tokenization",
        term: "Tokenization",
        short: "Breaking text into small pieces that the model can count and process.",
        visual: "Imagine a long discharge summary as a necklace. Tokenization cuts it into beads - tokens. The model works with beads, not the whole necklace.",
        usage: "People talk about token limits and cost per token. Models read and bill in tokens, not words, which explains why they can struggle with letter counting or word puzzles.",
        physician: "Think of tokenization like splitting a discharge summary into short bullet points so a colleague can skim it quickly. The AI splits text into units it understands and charges by those units.",
        scientist: "Tokenization maps raw text to a sequence of discrete vocabulary indices that the model operates on. It is analogous to converting DNA sequences into k-mers or amino acids into numeric codes before modeling.",
        researcher: "Tokenization defines the unit of analysis and sets hard context limits. When you send a trial protocol or paper, only a fixed number of tokens fit in a single request, which constrains how much material the assistant can process at once."
      },
      {
        id: "embeddings",
        term: "Embeddings",
        short: "Numerical coordinates that place words and concepts in a shared meaning space.",
        visual: "Picture a huge 3D map where similar things sit close together: aspirin near NSAID, far from tourism. Embeddings are the coordinates of each word on that map.",
        usage: "People say they use embeddings for search or similarity. They compare numeric vectors instead of raw strings, so models know that myocardial infarction and heart attack are related.",
        physician: "Embeddings let an AI know that MI, myocardial infarction, and heart attack belong together. It can find relevant information even when wording differs from the guideline you remember.",
        scientist: "Embeddings are high dimensional feature vectors learned from data. Distances encode semantic similarity, similar to representing gene expression profiles or molecular fingerprints in a common space.",
        researcher: "Embeddings allow smart search and patient-like-this retrieval. Trial documents, patient notes, and outcomes can be embedded and compared to find similar cases, protocols, or cohorts."
      },
      {
        id: "latent-space",
        term: "Latent space",
        short: "The internal concept space where the model organizes meanings and patterns.",
        visual: "Latent space is like a galaxy map of concepts. When you ask a question, the model flies to the region where similar meanings cluster and samples an answer from there.",
        usage: "Researchers talk about navigating latent space or latent representations when describing how models encode topics, disease clusters, or language structure internally.",
        physician: "Imagine every patient you have seen arranged in a big mental space where similar cases sit near each other. Latent space is the model's internal version of that clinical intuition.",
        scientist: "Latent space is a compressed internal representation, like the low dimensional manifolds discovered by PCA or autoencoders. It captures structure such as topics or phenotypes without explicit labels.",
        researcher: "Latent space can implicitly separate disease subtypes, risk groups, or response patterns, even if they were never labeled. It is one reason large models can support unsupervised phenotyping and stratification."
      },
      {
        id: "hallucinations",
        term: "Hallucinations",
        short: "Confident but incorrect or fabricated outputs produced by the model.",
        visual: "Hallucinations are like a trainee who, instead of saying I don’t know, confidently invents a journal article or lab value that sounds right but does not exist.",
        usage: "Hallucinations happen when the model fills gaps in its knowledge by pattern completion instead of accessing ground truth. They are especially risky in medicine because they sound authoritative.",
        physician: "A hallucination might be a made up reference, a non-existent drug interaction, or a plausible but wrong diagnostic explanation. Treat model outputs as drafts to be checked, not final orders.",
        scientist: "Hallucinations arise because the model is a probabilistic next-token generator, not a database. In sparse areas of latent space it extrapolates, sometimes producing text with no factual grounding.",
        researcher: "In clinical research, hallucinations can appear as invented trial names, wrong sample sizes, or fabricated statistics. Always verify citations, numbers, and claims against primary sources and registries."
      },
      {
        id: "positional-encoding",
        term: "Positional encoding",
        short: "Signals that tell the model the order of tokens in a sequence.",
        visual: "If tokens are beads on a string, positional encoding is the numbering of each bead so the model knows which came first. It is like giving every word a timestamp in a sentence's dance routine.",
        usage: "Transformers ignore order by default. Positional encodings, often sine and cosine waves or rotary embeddings, reintroduce information about word positions.",
        physician: "The sentence the patient denied chest pain is different from initially chest pain, now resolved. Positional encoding helps the model keep track of such sequences and avoid mixing up who did what to whom.",
        scientist: "Positional encodings add structured signals (often sinusoidal patterns) to token vectors so attention layers can distinguish positions. They are analogous to including time indices in time series models.",
        researcher: "Order matters for clinical course descriptions. Positional encodings allow the model to reason about symptom onset, imaging, treatment, and outcome as a sequence rather than a bag of events."
      },
      {
        id: "prompt-engineering",
        term: "Prompt engineering",
        short: "The craft of writing good instructions and context for the model.",
        visual: "Think of a prompt as a consult request. If you write a vague consult, you get a vague answer. If you clearly state the question, context, and what decision depends on it, the response is more useful.",
        usage: "People say they engineer prompts when they structure instructions, examples, and constraints so the model stays on task and behaves consistently.",
        physician: "Prompt engineering is like writing a focused question for radiology or pathology. You give brief clinical history, the key concern, and what you want clarified, not just please comment.",
        scientist: "It is similar to specifying clear inputs and outputs for a bioinformatics pipeline. The clearer your constraints, the fewer ambiguous or off target outputs you get.",
        researcher: "You can think of prompts as mini protocols for the model, specifying what data to consider, which comparisons to make, and what form of answer is desired, such as a PICO style summary."
      },
      {
        id: "temperature",
        term: "Temperature (creativity setting)",
        short: "A dial that controls how predictable or creative the model's outputs are.",
        visual: "Temperature is a creativity thermostat. Turn it down and you get calm, predictable answers. Turn it up and answers become more varied, sometimes brilliant, sometimes chaotic.",
        usage: "Low temperature is used for coding, math, and factual tasks. Higher temperature is used for brainstorming, wording variations, and creative writing.",
        physician: "For clinical questions you want low temperature so answers are stable and reproducible. For brainstorming patient education phrases or analogies, a slightly higher setting can be helpful.",
        scientist: "For code, analysis plans, or reproducible protocol steps, keep the temperature low. For hypothesis generation, idea exploration, or alternative mechanisms, a higher temperature can give useful variety.",
        researcher: "When summarizing evidence or interpreting statistics, low temperature is safer. When exploring alternative trial designs, inclusion criteria, or grant language, moderate temperature can inspire options you might not have written yourself."
      },
      {
        id: "context-window",
        term: "Context window",
        short: "The amount of text the model can consider at once.",
        visual: "The context window is like a limited stack of chart pages on your desk. Once the pile is full, new pages push old ones off the stack.",
        usage: "People compare models by context size, such as 8k tokens versus 200k tokens. Larger windows can hold longer documents or conversation history in one request.",
        physician: "A larger context allows the AI to read more of the chart, meds, and problem list at once, but still not an entire record. You sometimes need to send separate sections if they are very long.",
        scientist: "The context window limits how much text, code, or methods detail you can give in a single prompt. For very long protocols you may need chunking strategies and retrieval.",
        researcher: "For trial protocols, statistical analysis plans, or long manuscripts, context limits determine how much can be summarized or critiqued in one go. Retrieval augmented setups help extend this by pulling in only relevant sections."
      },
      {
        id: "sampling-methods",
        term: "Sampling methods",
        short: "Rules the model uses to pick the next word from its probability distribution.",
        visual: "Sampling is like driving on a highway. Beam search looks ahead for the best overall route, top k chooses from the top few exits, and nucleus sampling picks from the core cluster of likely options.",
        usage: "Developers choose sampling methods to trade off determinism and variety. Sampling choices shape style, coherence, and diversity of outputs.",
        physician: "Conservative sampling is better for dosing, guidelines, and documentation. More playful sampling is reasonable when you want different ways to explain a diagnosis or plan to a patient.",
        scientist: "Deterministic strategies such as greedy or low temperature top k help with reproducibility. More stochastic sampling discovers diverse phrasings, arguments, or hypotheses.",
        researcher: "Stable sampling is useful when extracting endpoints or summarizing trials. More varied sampling can surface alternative interpretations, subgroup considerations, or study designs you might explore in planning stages."
      },
      {
        id: "attention-heads",
        term: "Attention heads",
        short: "Parallel pattern detectors that focus on different relationships in the text.",
        visual: "Attention heads are like many inspectors reading the same document, each looking for a different pattern: drug names, numbers, pronouns, or negations.",
        usage: "Researchers visualize attention heads to interpret what models are tracking. Some heads specialize in syntax, others in long range dependencies or specific tokens.",
        physician: "It is like having multiple specialists at a case conference. One notices the medication interactions, another the subtle physical exam detail, another the imaging history. Attention heads do that mechanically for text.",
        scientist: "Each head computes a separate attention pattern over tokens, often emerging as specialized detectors for features such as coreference, negation, or numerical relationships.",
        researcher: "Some heads may implicitly track PICO elements or trial structure, which helps explain why models can often extract eligibility criteria or endpoints even without task specific training."
      },
      {
        id: "residual-streams",
        term: "Residual streams",
        short: "Connections that carry information forward through layers without erasing it.",
        visual: "Imagine a river passing through many locks. Each lock adds new features but the original water keeps flowing. Residual streams let layers add insight without losing the original signal.",
        usage: "Residual connections are crucial for deep models. They stabilize training and allow many layers to refine the same underlying representation.",
        physician: "Residual streams are like successive consults that add notes but never erase the initial history. Later reasoning stages still have access to your original question and context.",
        scientist: "Residual pathways support gradient flow in very deep networks and allow linear probes to read off features accumulated across layers.",
        researcher: "Thanks to residual streams, the model can preserve your initial clinical question deep into its computation, which helps with long reasoning chains in complex trial or cohort queries."
      },
      {
        id: "feature-superposition",
        term: "Feature superposition",
        short: "Packing many concepts into overlapping patterns in the same neurons.",
        visual: "A single neuron can act like a closet that holds several outfits. Depending on context, a different outfit comes to the front. One unit may respond to several unrelated ideas.",
        usage: "Feature superposition helps models use parameters efficiently but can cause strange associations when overlapping concepts interfere.",
        physician: "Think of fatigue as a symptom that appears in many diseases. A single neuron may partially represent several concepts, which can blur boundaries and sometimes produce odd analogies.",
        scientist: "Superposition is similar to compressed sparse coding. Many features share dimensions instead of each concept owning a separate dedicated neuron, which reduces parameter counts.",
        researcher: "Overlapping representations may contribute to unexpected correlations in outputs, such as linking diseases or populations that are not obviously related, which must be interpreted cautiously in clinical decision-support settings."
      },
      {
        id: "mixture-of-experts",
        term: "Mixture of experts",
        short: "Architectures that route each input to a small subset of specialized submodels.",
        visual: "Instead of using its whole brain every time, the model consults a panel of subspecialists. For a math question it calls the math experts, for a language question it calls language experts.",
        usage: "Mixture of experts models scale parameters while keeping compute per token lower, by activating only a few experts per input.",
        physician: "Conceptually it is like routing a referral to cardiology instead of paging every specialty at once. Only the relevant expert layers are used for your cardiology style question.",
        scientist: "Sparse MoE architectures use learned routers to pick a subset of expert blocks for each token. This greatly increases capacity without proportional increases in computation.",
        researcher: "In principle, different experts could specialize in oncology, cardiology, or neurology trial patterns, while sharing a base system. That could allow targeted performance boosts in each domain without training many separate models."
